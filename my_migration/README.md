My migration
=====

This example module will be shared with our Drupal 8 container as a volume.

It is meant to be an example of how you might filter content coming in from
Drupal 6 in order to make it available to Drupal 8.

It was built following the steps outlined in [Custom Drupal-to-Drupal Migrations with Migrate Tools](https://drupalize.me/blog/201605/custom-drupal-drupal-migrations-migrate-tools),
by William Hetherington, Drupalize.me, April 26, 2016.
